"""
interfaces define methods. Unlike classes, these methods are abstract. 
An abstract method is one that the interface simply defines. 
It doesn’t implement the methods. 
This is done by classes, which then implement the interface and give concrete meaning to the interface’s abstract methods.

"""
Python’s approach to interface design is somewhat different when compared to languages like Java, Go, and C++. These languages all have an interface keyword, while Python does not. Python further deviates from other languages in one other aspect. It doesn’t require the class that’s implementing the interface to define all of the interface’s abstract methods.
